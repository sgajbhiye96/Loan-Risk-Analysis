# Loan-Risk-Analysis

Solving this case study will give you an idea of how real-life business problems are solved using EDA. In this case study, you will apply the techniques that you have learnt in EDA. You will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data minimises the risk of losing money while lending it to customers.

 

Business Understanding
You work for a consumer finance company that specialises in providing various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, it has to decide whether to approve or reject it based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e., they are likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to financial loss for the company.

 

The data given below contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’. The aim is to identify patterns indicating that a person is likely to default, which may be used to deny the loan, reduce the loan amount, lend (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
